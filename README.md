## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (if applicable)
- scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment (Jupyter Lab/Notebook, Google Colab).

## Usage Instructions
- To run the initial analysis, open the `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially.
- For Model B and Model C testing, use the `AlphabetSoupCharity_OptimizationTesting.ipynb`.
- The `.h5` files contain the trained models and can be loaded using TensorFlow's `load_model` function.

## Results Summary
- See Neural Network Model Report.docx for the model results.
